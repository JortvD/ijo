IJO Server Manager. IJO means green, the symbol of environmentally friendly.

Web Host Manager is the most important think we need to manage our server. cPanel was the most popular web host manager in the world, but it only running under centos or redhat and other redhat linux variant. So wee need other web host manager that can running in other linux distribution or other operating system.

Many web host manager come with a lot of modules that actually not all we need. For example when i just want to manage Apache Web Server, but the web host manager apps also installed Mail Server, FTP Server, DNS Server, etc. So We need to develop lightweight web host manager that only install what we want to be installed.

## Why not use Webmin or other server manager software?

Webmin is very relevant, but the interfaces is very complicated by end user. I think cPanel still the best ui/ux for end user.

Sentora is similiar to cPanel, but sentora installed everything on the first installation.
